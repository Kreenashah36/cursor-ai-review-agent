# Problem Specialization

# Specialized Problem
This Agent is specialized for:
Deterministic, Structured AI-Native Code Review Workflows

## Why This Problem?
Modern AI tools act as assistants. However, engineering teams require:
Deterministic output, Structured reasoning, Repeatable evaluation, Security classification, Automated test generation

Default AI assistants are conversational.
Engineering workflows require orchestration.

## Why This Was 1 Priority
1)Code quality impacts production safety.
2)Security vulnerabilities are costly.
3)Test generation improves reliability.
4)Deterministic output enables automation.
5)AI-native workflows are the future of development.

This problem directly aligns with:
AI as the primary execution layer.
Instead of reviewing code manually,
we designed a system that enforces structured multi-agent reasoning inside Cursor.
